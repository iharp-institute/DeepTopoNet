# DeepTopoNet: Deep Learning for Bed Topography Estimation

This repository provides a PyTorch-based implementation of **DeepTopoNet**, a convolutional neural network designed for subglacial bed topography prediction using surface-derived features. The model leverages radar data, BedMachine-derived priors, and hybrid loss terms to improve bed elevation reconstruction in regions with sparse observational data.

## 🔧 Features

- Multi-modal feature integration: surface velocity, elevation, SMB, and dh/dt
- Gradient and trend surface augmentation to improve spatial modeling
- Hybrid loss combining radar-supervised and BedMachine-regularized terms
- Patch-based training using radar mask supervision

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install torch numpy pandas h5py
    ```
2. Prepare the `data/` folder:
    - Place the following files in `./data/`:
      - `hackathon.h5`
      - `bed_BedMachine.h5`
      - `data_full.csv`
3. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train_deeptoponet.py
    ```
Model checkpoints will be saved in `./saved_models/`.
